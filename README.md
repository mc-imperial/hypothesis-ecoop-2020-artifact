# Data for Test-Case Reduction via Test-Case Generation: Insights From the Hypothesis Reducer

This is the code to reproduce the results from our paper for ECOOP 2020.

Sadly due to COVID-19 related issues we were unable to get it in shape in time,
so please note that although the paper has been reviewed as part of the formal peer review process,
this artefact was not submitted for evaluation.

There are three experiments, each of which were written at slightly different times,
so each have slightly different set ups. We apologise for that, and for the absence of the analysis scripts
(which were rather tightly tied to our paper's LaTeX setup).
